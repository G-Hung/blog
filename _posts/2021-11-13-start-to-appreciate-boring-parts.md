### Start to appreciate 'boring' parts of life

For the last two years [since COVID], I have started to appreciate the “boring” parts of life, something I used to think are old school and not cool.

#### Work
At work, I have started to vote for a simple yet not naive approach, “simple” means easy to deliver solid things and no gotcha; “yet not naive” means there are enough spaces for the extension, just not now. In order to keep lazy, I have started to plan, draw and write down some key things if possible before I get started, I have started to execute slower before the math works out

To the younger me, this would sound impossible, I was very proud of myself with a good memory [even without notes] and the fanciest ways to accomplish something without steps. I remember back to secondary school time, I was quite good at math and always doing all the steps and calculations in my mind, the papers only contained a few unreadable steps and the final answers. If I needed to work with the younger me on some projects now, I would say “F you, don’t skip any steps, I have no interest in reading your mind, I don’t want to guess”!

#### Daily life
In daily life, I have started to work out regularly, eat breakfast and lately learn something daily. These are quite surprising changes to me, I recall I was one of the weakest [in terms of physical strength] people in secondary school and now I push the barbell and lift the dumbbell a few times per week in my room. I make my [the very same] breakfast after I wake up whereas I only had breakfast during the weekend because I need to have breakfast with my family [HK Dimsum!]. I now open the site to learn something after dinner, whereas I found some mobile games to spend my nights.

#### Social life
In social life, I kept on thinking about the cool events to go to with my friends, but now I really enjoy less-is-more ._. Just coming out, having a coffee/dinner, and chatting is enough to make me happy.

Not sure whether it means I am “older” now or COVID transforms me into this way, but I quite enjoy the current simple style if I could meet my friends even easier. The feeling of appreciating the “boring” parts recalls me of a song [苦瓜](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdWlBBqiC7I) by Eason Chan, sorry for those who can’t understand Chinese
