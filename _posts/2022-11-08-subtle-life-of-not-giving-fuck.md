### Background

This is an interesting [book](https://www.amazon.com/Subtle-Art-Not-Giving-Counterintuitive/dp/0062457713) I read recently, I found it addresses a lot of "mental" or "emotional" problems for me

Since COVID, I have felt like I am kind of like falling into a death spiral of a victim mindset. Since life treats me so shit and everything is off track, how else can I be happy? This book isn't encouraging me to be positive/be happy that kinds of bullshit [Not i don't want to, but how, logically], instead it invites me to review my values

To keep things short, the biggest gains from this books for me are:
- Things suck and shits happen, it is not [necessarily] our fault, but we have full responsibility to fix it. Remember, not your fault, but it is your responsibility
- Purse happiness is superficial, we will not satisfy with what we have. Instead, choose your struggle/pain because 1.) it is unavoidable 2.) it is the root source of true happiness
- Emotions are just the feedbacks generated from our value system and reality, we shouldn't ignore negative emotions, because it hints our value and reality may have some gaps
- Life is limited, don't give a shit to unimportant things or challenges on the road, give the fk to the selected battles!

### Summary of some chapters
Some core messages from the book force me to think for a while

- what are the things you give a fk?
   - There are only a handful of things that are worth our time
   - Everyone will die some days mean we can't choose infinite things to give a shit
- Realise life is a form of suffering but sometimes fun
   - The reality is there is shit everywhere, accept things suck sometimes/most of the time
- Happiness is not the equation, if X then Y doesn't work
   - human is made to be dissatisfied, you won't satisfy with what you have, that's the feature not a bug
   - True happiness occurs only when you find the problems you enjoy having and enjoy solving
   - So, choose your struggle, solve problems and be happy
   - solve problems come with pain, hence pain is the source of happiness
   - real, serious, lifelong fulfillment and meaning have to be earned through the choosing and managing of our struggles
- Two common traps for people: Denial and victim mentality
   - denial: deny the problems exist => hide => make a bigger problem
   - victim: blame others for the problem => quick high => nth change
- Emotions are just feedback signals of our value system toward reality
   - negative emotions are a call to action!
   - if we don't act/solve the problem, we will be unhappy
- Admit that we are just normal people, not special, and shouldn't be entitled
   - we are pretty avg at most of the things for most of us
   - Great is from improvement, growth mindset, anti-entitlement
   - Acceptance of this frees us to accomplish more, we are not special, but we can improve
- Change our metrics and value system
   - shitty values
       - pleasure/quick high
           - superficial pleasures end up more anxious and depressed instead
           - common in today's marketing
       - material success
           - After a certain threshold, $ isn't the most important factor [BUT they are very important still!]
       - Always be right
           - prevent from learning from mistakes, be humble, please
       - Staying positive
           - Deny negative emotions when things suck only leads to prolonged negative emotions
   - good values
       - reality-based
       - socially constructive
       - immediate and controllable, under your own control, eg: popularity isn't
       - examples
           - honesty, innovation, vulnerability, standing up, self-respect, curiosity, charity, humility, creativity
- The 5 values that this book focuses on/recommend
   - responsibility
       - Know the difference b/w fault and responsibility
       - Shits happen, not your fault, but it is your responsibility to get shit right
   - uncertainty
       - Accept the fact that you don't know a lot, remain open-minded
   - failure
       - Adopt the mindset that failure is good learning, it is just feedback from reality and we can learn from it
   - rejection
       - Reject and stay focused, not always choosing, this liberates us from choices!
   - contemplation of one's own mortality
       - Remember physical self will die! What do your conceptual self want to do then?
