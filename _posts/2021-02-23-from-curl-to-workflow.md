### This is an old article I posted in Medium, I may just provide the link without reproducing it here!

When we work in DS field, the most important thing is data. But we don't want to handle the things manually because it means mistakes and demands people to work like a machine.

This article discusses how to make a pipeline to hold data from ARK fund, load them to Google BigQuery, checking the data quality using dbt, the whole workflow is managed and automated by GitHub Actions!
