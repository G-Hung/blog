# [Medium link](https://towardsdatascience.com/from-jupyter-notebook-to-sc-582978d3c0c)

### This is an old article I posted in Medium, I may just provide the link without reproducing it here!

This article records part of my learnings from my practicum at Manifold AI! I remember I was a big fan of Jupyter Notebook and wanted to use it for everything!

My first time to use Jupyter Notebook in work [not exploration / homework] was to try Databricks to handle some data processing works. I was amazed by the notebook style because I am not from CS background and I would love to see what is happening in every step!

But I found that those colleagues with CS background don't prefer this way, I had no clues why. Slowly, I started to feel inconvenient too when the processing logics are more and more complex.......Well, things are still working.......

Until I worked in Manifold AI and needed to write the whole workflow, I finally found that it is much much easier & more flexible to run the code by a list of commands instead of a long Notebook......

Plus, I have the habit to write unit tests whenever possible after I experienced how painful it is when you try to refactor any non-trival codebase.

During the painful job searching period in 2020 [wtf graduated during COVID-19], I didn't have many things to do so I summarized and wrote this up.
