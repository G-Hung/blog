This is what I have struggled in my mind over the years, what is a good DS job……. To solve this problem, I have created the checklist/questions which I hope the previous me could read before making the career decision. I won’t talk about compensation / tech details / interviews, that’s another story You are not always in the position to choose (such as finding jobs during COVID-19) but you should seriously evaluate your options if you can Job nature There are thousands of jobs sharing the same title, eg: data scientist, data engineer, ml engineer. But they could be totally different from company to company, be aware! The first thing I will look into is the skill requirements to identify the job nature If it is analytics, expect tons of SQL, dashboards, presentations, product analytics, experimental designs. You probably need to enjoy talking to people, finding insights, guiding the business, which means you need to be a domain expert in that business. In short, I think it is more like a business/PM/consultant type of roles, but from data perspective If it is engineering, be alert if the job responsibilities are vague, don’t make assumptions, let me repeat: don’t make assumptions! For example, the people who share the data engineer title may do completely different things. Some are developing ETL pipelines; some are working on instrumentation; some are building the new data / ML infrastructure. You should think clearly whether that fits your career plan! Also, another common “trap” is internal transfer, you want to get into the company first and switch to the roles you want, while I don’t deny the possibility, don’t be over-optimistic in your calculation, hope is not a strategy</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://g-hung.github.io/blog/images/post/job_choice.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://g-hung.github.io/blog/images/post/job_choice.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry></feed>
