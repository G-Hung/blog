            "title": "Book Review: The subtle art of not giving a fk",
            "content": "Background . This is an interesting book I read recently, I found it addresses a lot of “mental” or “emotional” problems for me . Since COVID, I have felt like I am kind of like falling into a death spiral of a victim mindset. Since life treats me so shit and everything is off track, how else can I be happy? This book isn’t encouraging me to be positive/be happy that kinds of bullshit [Not i don’t want to, but how, logically], instead it invites me to review my values . To keep things short, the biggest gains from this books for me are: . Things suck and shits happen, it is not [necessarily] our fault, but we have full responsibility to fix it. Remember, not your fault, but it is your responsibility | Purse happiness is superficial, we will not satisfy with what we have. Instead, choose your struggle/pain because 1.) it is unavoidable 2.) it is the root source of true happiness | Emotions are just the feedbacks generated from our value system and reality, we shouldn’t ignore negative emotions, because it hints our value and reality may have some gaps | Life is limited, don’t give a shit to unimportant things or challenges on the road, give the fk to the selected battles! | . Summary of some chapters . Some core messages from the book force me to think for a while . what are the things you give a fk? There are only a handful of things that are worth our time | Everyone will die some days mean we can’t choose infinite things to give a shit | . | Realise life is a form of suffering but sometimes fun The reality is there is shit everywhere, accept things suck sometimes/most of the time | . | Happiness is not the equation, if X then Y doesn’t work human is made to be dissatisfied, you won’t satisfy with what you have, that’s the feature not a bug | True happiness occurs only when you find the problems you enjoy having and enjoy solving | So, choose your struggle, solve problems and be happy | solve problems come with pain, hence pain is the source of happiness | real, serious, lifelong fulfillment and meaning have to be earned through the choosing and managing of our struggles | . | Two common traps for people: Denial and victim mentality denial: deny the problems exist =&gt; hide =&gt; make a bigger problem | victim: blame others for the problem =&gt; quick high =&gt; nth change | . | Emotions are just feedback signals of our value system toward reality negative emotions are a call to action! | if we don’t act/solve the problem, we will be unhappy | . | Admit that we are just normal people, not special, and shouldn’t be entitled we are pretty avg at most of the things for most of us | Great is from improvement, growth mindset, anti-entitlement | Acceptance of this frees us to accomplish more, we are not special, but we can improve | . | Change our metrics and value system shitty values pleasure/quick high superficial pleasures end up more anxious and depressed instead | common in today’s marketing | . | material success After a certain threshold, $ isn’t the most important factor [BUT they are very important still!] | . | Always be right prevent from learning from mistakes, be humble, please | . | Staying positive Deny negative emotions when things suck only leads to prolonged negative emotions | . | . | good values reality-based | socially constructive | immediate and controllable, under your own control, eg: popularity isn’t | examples honesty, innovation, vulnerability, standing up, self-respect, curiosity, charity, humility, creativity | . | . | . | The 5 values that this book focuses on/recommend responsibility Know the difference b/w fault and responsibility | Shits happen, not your fault, but it is your responsibility to get shit right | . | uncertainty Accept the fact that you don’t know a lot, remain open-minded | . | failure Adopt the mindset that failure is good learning, it is just feedback from reality and we can learn from it | . | rejection Reject and stay focused, not always choosing, this liberates us from choices! | . | contemplation of one’s own mortality Remember physical self will die! What do your conceptual self want to do then? | . | . | .",

            "title": "70/30 rule",
            "content": "About delaying the decision . I don’t know whether it is education or what, I prefer certainty &amp; correctness, I would delay the decision until everything is almost settled. . While delaying the decision have the benefit of outcomes with certainty [hence I am almost always “correct”], being correct and having a good outcome are two different things. Our true objective is to have a good outcome, not being correct all the time. But this often traps the people, especially those well-educated [winners from the exam system] . This pattern happens a lot in my previous life: . I like a girl, but I delay the decision to keep on collecting the information and guess | I want a job, but I delay the decision to ask, just prepare behind the scene | I want a hangout, but I delay the decision to ask until others also say they want to meet | I want a promotion, but I delay the decision to ask because I think the people should see my great works | I have a business idea, but I delay the decision to start until I see others execute &amp; plan it poorly yet succeed | . In the end, I am almost correct every time, I get what I correctly predict, unfortunately, that’s probably not the outcome I desire . 70/30 rule . I notice this issue back in college time, I keep on pursuing the almost 95% certainty before I make the final decision. Once I make the decision, I could become super efficient. But situations often change, and those well-designed plans are no longer needed/useful . From my statistics background, I should be able to learn more lessons from the expected value formula earlier . Using imprecise language, the expected value is the average value you can get from repeated trials lesson 1: If the outcome just hurts our feeling in the worst case, we should pick the strategy with the max outcome and play multiple times, and ignore the failures | lesson 2: Avoid things that make you cannot play multiple times, eg: illegal activities, life-risking activities | . | Empirically, P(X) and X are usually unproportional lesson 3: If P(X) is high [you pretty certain about the outcome], X is usually low [outcome is bad], ie: low-risk low return | lesson 4: If P(X) is low [taking risk], X maybe high [outcome maybe great], ie: high risk [maybe] high return | lesson 5: from lesson 4, even if we take risks, only accept those with potentially high returns, ie: don’t cross a red light, don’t cross stop signs, these high-risk activities don’t have a high return | . | . The rule of thumb for me then is the 70/30 rule, if: . I am 70% certain about positive expected value AND | I can afford the lousy outcome | . Then I should just do it. . Interestingly, for that 30% of a bad outcome, even in the worst case, it is usually not a big deal in hindsight, ie: if you win, +ve value; if you lose, only small -ve value . Since our actions can also affect the outcome and its probability, based on mathematics, we should take more calculated risks and be optimists . This rule increases my options because I don’t need to be correct all the time. My objective function is the high positive expected value, not the high accuracy of predicted outcomes. Rejection and embarrassment are not the evaluation metrics in the former case . End this with an interesting quote: Pessimists are usually right and optimists are usually wrong. But all the great changes have been accomplished by optimists. .",

            "title": "Book Review: Set for life",
            "content": "Background . This is a book I read recently and I found that it fills a lot of personal finance knowledge/cognition gap for me, after all, my whole education is around science and technology, and I wasn’t exposed to this money-related knowledge. . Since it is so important, I decide to write an article to summarize the understanding, instead of quoting the books word by word, I use point form to summarize the stages and end with a question-oriented approach on how this book answers some of my questions. . Overall game plan suggested by the book . The book breaks the game into 3 stages, I think it is good because it sets a concrete goal &amp; metrics, the problem becomes an engineering problem . Before moving to those stages, let’s talk about the metrics. The metrics that the book describes focus on income and cash flow. The definition of net worth only counts cash/deposit, market securities [eg: stock, bond, Crypto [maybe?], those that are able to convert to real cash in a few days], and income-generating assets. . Under this definition, houses with negative cash flow don’t count, car doesn’t count, digital devices don’t count, luxury furniture doesn’t count, New 8K TV in the living room doesn’t count, Branded items don’t count…… . Also, we assume during this process, you don’t have external financial help [eg: your parent send you a million after graduation; win a lottery], in the author’s words, the path for average Joe . Stage 1: Safety net . KPI: 25K USD OR 6 months financial runway, pick a higher one Financial runway is defined as if you don’t work today, how long can you survive eg: if you spend 1000 USD per month, 6 months financial runway will be 6000 USD | eg: if you spend 3000 USD per month with a 5000 USD monthly mortgage, 6 months financial runway will be 8000*6 = 48000 USD | . | . | Analysis: How long it takes depends on two factors Your expense | Your income | . | Income is hard to scale when you just start, therefore, you can only focus on expenses, and save money by reducing the expense eg: 50% saving rate can get 6 months financial runway in 6 months/0.5 years | eg: 25% saving rate can get 6 months financial runway in 18 months/1.5 years | eg: 10% saving rate can get 6 months financial runway in 54 months/4.5 years | . | The examples show the importance of saving rate, a high saving rate means low expense, low expense lifestyle also enables you to have a longer runway using the same amount of money | Financial runway isn’t related to the numbers on the paychecks, even if you make 100K per month, if you spend 90K, then you still need 4.5 years to have 6 months’ financial runway | . | Pathway: Every dollar you spend is post-tax, and every dollar you earn is pre-tax. Saving 1 dollar has a higher ROI than earning 1 dollar | The main way to achieve this is saving, which means we need to review our cash flow and eliminate the big unnecessary expenses, usually: Housing: You don’t need a luxury apartment | Car: You don’t need a brand new European car or a limited version | Eat out: You can cook yourself | whatever expensive things that don&#39;t have return: limit them | . | It doesn’t mean you have to be cheap, you can still have coffee, and eat out, as long as you maintain a high saving rate | . | Estimated time Suppose you can save 2K per month, 25K takes you around 1 year | . | Unlock: After this stage, we can unlock some traits to enable the next stage the freedom to take risks even short-term returns may be low | the initial capital to invest if you will | build a low-expense yet healthy lifestyle | . | . | . Stage 2: First gold . KPI: 100K USD net worth [reminder: definition of net worth here doesn’t count assets with negative cash flow] | Analysis: After stage 1, you probably don’t have a lot of space to further compress the expense, hence we need to focus on income | A possible way to further significantly reduce your expense is by purchasing a house using the 25K USD in stage 1 and then doing house hacking [ie: rent part of it out and live there for free] Although this advice isn’t feasible in expensive places such as the SF Bay area/NY | . | . | Pathway: To increase the income, the book doesn’t provide secrets, these are typical advise Focus on jobs with scalable income/future, eg: sales, tech, those with potential big uplift | Develop new income streams | Startup? Then you have 25K from stage 1 as initial capital | Keep learning marketable skills | Investment, probably index fund Side note: the author doesn’t suggest picking stock, at least when your capital is small, there are two outcomes You do worse than an index fund, then why don’t you just buy it? | You do better than an index fund, is the extra gain worth your effort? | . | . | . | . | Estimated time Suppose you can save 2K per month, an extra 75K takes you around 3 years | But this stage focuses on income growth, every tiny increase given you don’t upgrade the lifestyle will reduce the time required | . | Unlock: After this stage, we can unlock some traits to enable the next stage The first gold in your pocket enables more possibilities | The freedom to take an even bigger risk if you spend 3K per month, 100K is almost 3 years’ financial runway | . | The investment return becomes more meaningful 1000 USD, 10% return is 100 USD, it won’t change your life even with a 20% return | 100000 USD, 10% return is 10000 USD, it is not neglectable | . | . | . | . Stage 3: Reach financial independence . KPI: Increase your financial runway to 10 years or even forever | Analysis: There is no single way to reach the final goal, no magic | Keep developing/growing new income streams, keep the relatively low-expense lifestyle, and use the capital to obtain/build more assets | Common things include: Investment | Real Estate | Business | . | . | Estimated time Suppose you have a 50% saving rate, no salary increase &amp; investment return but grow at an inflation rate, this can enable you to early retire by a decade or two. | . | Unlock: After this stage, we can unlock the final prize The freedom to decide whether you want to work or not | . | You are in a very healthy financial position to try those luxury things, as long as the non-wage income growth is faster than the expense | . | . Questions . Some questions were always in my mind before I read this book | . Why should we save money? What should be the saving rate? When is it the end? . Saving money enables us to take more risks/have more freedom, it also provides us the initial capital. The saving rate depends on your goal and lifestyle, usually from the beginning, saving is easier than an income increase, also considering the tax benefit, saving is post-tax, and earning is pre-tax. . If we can maintain a low-cost [yet healthy] lifestyle, then the pure frugality phase [just save money without doing anything] isn’t that long before more options are enabled. Saving is to build the basic safety net and increase our financial runway, it will end only if your income streams other than wage can cover your expense [ie: infinite runway], then we are in a very healthy position to spend more . The contents are nothing new, what are the values of the book? . I agree that the contents are not new or secret. The value of this book is to provide a framework, and concrete goals, and explain the rationale behind those suggestions. . For example, saving &amp; a low-cost lifestyle are important tools for building a safety net, but if you rely on that alone for a financial runway, it will be too long, esp. under high inflation. Therefore, the importance shifts in different stages, each stage has its own focus and priority. . This book shares what are the options and priorities in different stages, it is not optimal to consider investment when your bank account only has a few hundred, or even worse, many debts; it is not optimal to focus on further lifestyle saving when your net worth is more than 100K, the focus should be on creating more revenue streams. . Why do some people prefer index funds if they want to invest in the stock market? . There are two scenarios: . If You do worse than the index fund, then why don’t you just invest in the index fund? | You outperform index funds, does it worth your effort? Given buy-and-hold index fund doesn’t result in any immediate tax, doesn’t require the effort to research and time the market, and is low cost | Unless you can consistently outperform the market by 10X or with a large capital pool [100K USD as a unit], it doesn’t worth the effort . Also, there is something called an equity credit line to enable you to get the money without selling [no capital gain], the risk is if the reference asset drop too much, the firm will liquidize them [ie: execute the sell at a cheap price to secure their money]. For the same amount of money, do you want an index fund or some growth stocks as your reference asset? . Why should we not upgrade the lifestyle easily? . For example . Suppose originally you make 100K, you save 50K [ie: 50% saving rate] | Now you change the job and earn 200K, you save 60K [ie: lower saving rate, 30%; higher absolute saving amount] | . The issue of this example is, that although you save more, you actually reduce your financial runway. For any extra month of the financial runway, originally you need 50K, now you need 140K to maintain the same standard. This naturally forces you to rely on your job even more . But if you just spend 10K more, your saving rate increases from 50% [save 50K from 100K] to 70% [save 140K from 200K]. This actually strengthens your financial position a lot, the takeaway from this example is the key consideration should be financial runway, which is controlled by saving rate [it doesn’t mean wage is your only income] . How can we have a low-cost yet healthy lifestyle? . I don’t like to be too extreme, things such as avoiding social gatherings, no entertainment at all, saving the coffee chat, etc are the last things I want to do. A high saving rate doesn’t mean living like a poor, I can survive pretty well with around a 50% saving rate without missing any social event [maybe COVID is special?] . Here are the things I do for my expense: . First, only plan using base salary, don’t count RSU or bonus as your realized income, they should be treated as a bonus | Then I allocate 1000 for food &amp; drink Because I start to work out, I want to eat healthily and measure my precise intake, therefore, I have applied for a Costco membership [120 USD annually, cashback should cover the membership] since their goods contain scannable nutrition labels. Tips: Prepare a shopping list to avoid over-buy in Costco | . | Using Costco ingredients cost me on average 5-10 dollars per high-protein meal, 15-20 dollars as max [the luxury meal will have restaurant-grade prime beef, Scallops, lobster tails] | Even with high protein &amp; healthy diets, my average spend per day on food is around 20 dollars, this leaves me 400-500 USD for social events | . | I also allocate 500 to spend at will Since I go to the gym [membership costs me 50 USD per month, currently I go there 3 times per week], 50 USD for a healthy body and around 24 hours of “entertainment” per month, not a bad deal | Some are used to buy books, random stuff from Amazon, some subscriptions, dentist, new glass, travel | . | While I can compress these expenses to save extra 3-400 dollars, it will seriously affect my happiness level and social life which makes it unsustainable, finding a balance with some percentages of dollars is acceptable for me | . Something I have to spend: . Rent bay area rent is so expensive, yet I can’t find a way to skip that, given I want to live safe, quiet, not too close/far from the population | . | Car I fail to do what the book suggests: buy a used efficient car. Not that I don’t want to, but if you see the car market after 2021 [When I started to look for a car], the prices are insane, especially for the used cars. | I land on a brand new low-end Camry and pay the MSRP, quite enjoy it! | Having a car enables me to go to Costco and Gym room, and dinner with friends without Uber, maybe I should attribute some savings to the car cost :) | . | . Leftover . BTW, as I mention, I only use my base salary for the planning. I also assume every month gets two paychecks. Therefore, there are two extra paychecks out of my equation [Since 1 year has 52 weeks, 52/2=26 paychecks, 26-24 = 2 paychecks]. It can act as a buffer or sponsor my year-end go-home trip . Together with bonuses, stock compensation, etc, these extra dollars can further increase the average saving rate to 60%+ depending on your luck. But since these are not under our control, we shouldn’t bet it will work out in the way that favors us. Plan for the worst, and hope for the best! . Something I think they are worth spending more on even if they are expensive . Those I use daily / have high ROI . A good smartphone/notebook/smartwatch: prob. not the latest and most advanced version, but having a reliable one is peace of mind | Dyson fan……Well I think it doesn’t sound like low-cost living, but having one in the room is really nice, and it adjusts itself for almost all weather | Comfortable, durable &amp; high-quality apparel: have a few in the closet as a no-brain choice | A good air fryer: enable you to make delicious food, save time &amp; money | . What are some good income streams other than wages? . I don’t know as well, let me know if you spot some. But strong financial position [high income, high saving rate, high net worth] enables us to seize the opportunity when it comes .",

            "title": "Digital Detox",
            "content": "Beginning . A few years before, I had read a book called Deep Work by Cal Newport. One of the aggressive advice he gave was not to use digital devices &amp; social networks. . During that time, I also read another article by the New York Times which shows that the software companies [eg: Basically everything under Meta] includes a lot of subconscious tricks using color and UX design to hook you. The suggestion is to turn on the color filter to grayscale, then the apps will become much less attractive. . I tried and it works, things are much less attractive but this setting is also very inconvenient, eg: sometimes for work, I need to see the photos in color; sometimes for food ordering, I really want to use the color view. While changing it back to color view takes 10-20 seconds which is socially awkward back in the day before COVID. . Therefore, I gave up after 2 weeks…… . Recent discovery . Recently, I discovered iOS devices have an excellent workaround for this! . settings &gt; accessibility &gt; accessibility shortcut &gt; select color filters . Then when you hit the home button 3 times quickly, accessibility mode will be turned on/off. This means I can swap b/w color and gray mode within a second and it looks like a more pragmatic option. . After all, you probably don’t want to use Google Maps in gray mode when you drive. You probably don’t want to see the photos from your family group in gray mode. . This mode offers a good tradeoff, if you really need color mode, then you can turn off the filter effortlessly . Experiment . I discovered this trick around the end of July 2022 and I am planning to do an experiment for 21 days to see the effects [such as device use time, apps use time] and build a habit. . I will update this post in early Sept and see whether it works! . But at least for the first few days, the apps are not that attractive to me now, I really just use the apps to look for the info, reply to the message, and that’s it! . Isn’t this the role of digital devices!? They are the tools, we manipulate them, not they manipulate us, the gray mode option forces me to decide whether I really need to see things in color . Levels of digital detox . Gray mode with easy on/off | Gray mode with difficult on/off [don’t use accessibility] | Don’t use at all - suggested by Deep work | To reclaim our life, I think level 1 is sufficient and pragmatic for people in modern &amp; busy life .",

            "content": "Recent life . 2022 Q2 is an interesting period for me, for the first time since COVID, I can escape from constant struggle and mentally self-consuming cycle. I don’t spend an excessive amount of time on interview preparation such as leetcode, knowledge even without the immediate needs, kind of like preparation for preparation. . So why? Because I am lucky and won the H1B lottery this year. I mentioned in the previous article that this is a pure luck game, I attribute 100% of this outcome to luck rather than my own effort compared with other applicants. . But this is important because I can shift from survival mode to alive mode. Similar to when you fall into the water without a life jacket, if you can step on the ground, even if you are still in the water, you are in a much better position to plan and think about things. . So finally I can shift the focus to learn/do something I am interested in, those important but not urgent things . Workout &amp; diet . One night in May, in front of the mirror, I said what was going on with my body. Apparently, my belly fat is quite obvious even after I dress on……. . Although I can blame COVID for this again, after all, COVID doesn’t have an entity that I can submit my claim to, therefore I signed up for a gym room 10 minutes drive from my home. I researched the training and nutrition plans that are suitable for my stage, and I watched a lot of youtube videos to refresh myself on how to press, pull, and squat properly. . But I know I am an easy give-up type, therefore, I need to design a lifestyle system to support it. . So I collected some common reasons for not going workout or following a healthy diet based on my own historical records: . It is soooooo tired after work OR there are some events tonight OR workout after work kills my whole night to do something =&gt; let’s take a rest for a day, to address this I just wake up early and workout before work | I prepare the ready-to-go workout package [bottle, gym glove, deadlift straps, protein bar] | I force myself to sleep early | I turn on the every app limit in iOS after 10pm | I use iPhone notes to plan everything I need to do in the next workout | . | The impacts are quite interesting . I become a morning person | I didn’t miss a single workout for 2 months [I do 3 times per week currently] | . It is soooooo hard to eat healthy and precise, ordering Ubereat is so convenient! To address this I have learned how to read nutrition labels | I signed up for a Costco membership, do bulk purchases every 2 weeks, and prepare my own food thanks to remote work I can prepare the food myself for all the meals | eating using Costco ingredients during weekdays saves a LOT even I bought whatever I want to eat in Costco [healthy foods of course]! | . | I bought a scale with a 0.1-gram accuracy level | I have used an app called MyFitnessPal to track everything I eat | . | The impacts cover different areas . I save a lot on food and it is quite easy to track once the routine is there | Now I don’t like to eat out not because I am cheap, but because it is difficult to track nutrition | I learn how to use Air fryer and cook well in a short period of time :) | I am accumulating the materials to make a food blog on eating well and delicious, cheap and easy LOL | . BTW, I am not a healthy diet extremist, I still eat out with friends and have some cheat meals on weekdays. A good lifestyle that you can keep consistently is far better than the best habit if it is not sustainable . Personal finance . I spent an extensive amount of time reading and thinking about this book Set for Life: Dominate Life, Money, and the American Dream. For my education in the past, I wasn’t exposed to money-related stuff a lot, partly because I was not interested in that [too idealistic at that time], partly because there are no courses/books/materials [from those I read before] with a “system” view. . Yeah, we know saving is important, and investment is important. At the same time, there are also voices such as there is no point to keep so much cash during high inflation, getting a salary cannot get you rich, owning assets is the king, etc. . Well, these are all right in theory but how can we link them all together, to understand the purpose, strategy, and tradeoff of each action, ideally stage-by-stage implementation &amp; tracking just like a gym workout plan? . From this perspective, I think this is a good book that answers all these questions, I may not agree with every suggestion it provides but I think the framework &amp; the maths make sense and provide a practical pathway to achieve the so-called financial freedom [yeah, I prefer the scientific/engineering way, show me the formula, metrics, steps, and examples, don’t tell me what does it feel when you become rich, tell me how to become rich legally] . In short, all the suggestions can be summarized in one sentence: reduce expense [80/20 rule, don’t be cheap on the little entertainment, target the elepant in the room], increase income [remarks: wage &amp; income are different], invest the difference until it can self-sustain and support your life . Set for Life: Dominate Life, Money, and the American Dream . Accounting &amp; Negotiation . Another area that I am spending time on is some business-related courses on Coursera. Again, my education didn’t cover these areas a lot. Through my work experience, I have learned more about the different business models but I don’t know much about the financial side. . In the workplace sometimes I heard certain decisions are made because of P&amp;L, something needs to be done because of finance/accounting practices, for management after a certain grade they need to manage their own P&amp;L? What the hell does these mean!? I can deliver my own works well but it seems there is another set of games other than the business model. . So I am spending time to explore that world [and it is quite interesting actually, but I feel like I have more questions on how to fraudulence (or detect fraud :-) ) the financial statements] Accounting . Another course I am working on is negotiation by Yale, I took a game theory class back as an undergraduate and read some books about that but I didn’t think these are very practical. But this course is super practical in terms of providing a unified framework to approach negotiation [not necessarily business negotiation actually, it could be used to explain &amp; predict a lot of real-life behaviors]. In short, always understand the pie and the added values of different options. . Negotiation by Yale . Distributed system . I am also reading a book called Designing Data-Intensive applications, things make sense and open a whole new world to me, but I don’t feel I can fully understand some distributed system concepts [theory part, those clocks, order, consensus things]. .

            "content": "Imagined reality . Animals, probably just optimize their short-term interest, they probably take actions based on food, safety, and reproduction, things that are concrete, physical, and objective. . It is interesting for humans because we make decisions on something/concepts that may not exist in an objective world. I have read “A brief history of humankind” by Yuval Noah Harari, one of the interesting perspectives is that human is the only creature that lives in both physical and subjective worlds. . Money is the greatest example, money is no more than just a paper or a digit in the app, yet it drives the whole society. Most of us allocate our weekdays to work to earn some money and expect the digits can exchange for something we want, but it is just the imagined reality in our minds! . Decision making . People growing up from different cultures and environments form their own imagined reality, together with the internet, it creates some interesting disagreements, ideologies, or perspectives that are formulated on top of imagined reality. . Some examples I have seen recently: PS: no right or wrong, just whether I think it is a reasonable argument . COVID vaccines . Some people don’t take vaccines because: . They dislike the authority “forcing” people to take it, it violates human freedom and free will | They have the freedom to access the risk to decide on their own | . My view: While it is your right to decide to take or not, I don’t really agree with the vague &amp; potentially subjective concepts such as freedom should be used as an argument, because it implies the good and bad side implicitly. Whether to do something in the physical world should depend on objective evidence. . In this case, how effective are the vaccines against COVID? what are the side effects? what are the consequences to society if we don’t take vaccines? If the argument is we don’t know the side effects, it makes sense to me. But if we are using conspiracy theories or extreme examples or other stories to manipulate human emotion is not. . Herd immunity or clear zero policy in China . Herd immunity: clear zero policy isn’t sustainable Clear zero: we should clear zero at whatever cost because potential casualty is huge . My view: When both sides have reasonable arguments, then let’s just consider the objective evidence . clear zero policy is not sustainable =&gt; True | potential casualty is huge =&gt; maybe True. | . From here we can consider what something we should/we can do, for example, whether the vaccination rate of certain groups isn’t high enough, whether we don’t have enough equipment to support the cases, and whether it is possible to release stage by stage, etc . Driving the discussion to actionable items, something that is concrete is one of the most effective ways to end the concept game, especially when the imagined reality of both sides is not aligned. . Mind templates . Some of my favorite templates in the workplace/daily life: . Don’t deal with abstract concepts, say: give me an example | Don’t use the subjective expression, say: I see xyz, therefore, I interpret it as abc | Challenge the ground, say: you say abc, what makes you have such impressions/thoughts | Or simply ask: why? | .",

            "title": "Real life statistics",
            "content": "Statistics . My bachelor’s degree is in statistics, to me, statistics tries to handle/model/measure random events. To do that, people define random events [usually use poker card/dice as examples] and associated probability distributions, then from there expand to some key measurements such as expected value, variance, etc etc . I think I can handle the problems in homework and exams quite well, but the real lessons of statistics, if we are not doing research, is to apply it in our daily life. Over the last two years during COVID, I counter that multiple times . Example 1: Job searching . Since I graduated during a “historical moment”, the job market is cruel to everyone, especially those who just started. The market successfully turns interview/offer probability to almost zero [side note: when I asked people from the previous/next cohort, how many applications do they send? They said a lot, almost 100 and I laughed.] . But the point is statistics, if you have taken a statistics class, the problem set usually has some questions to calculate the probability of at least one event happening. I know if the probability is not exactly zero, I am likely to succeed in at least one in the end. . However, calculation and reality are different, humans are not rational all the time, especially under uncertainty. I think it is similar to investment, can we be disciplined and make rational decisions all the time? . My 1st lesson is: It is hard, it is not about knowledge or whether we know the “right answer”, it is about how can we manage our mind and emotion . My 2nd lesson is: Because of the first lesson, don’t make important decisions when we are emotional/under scarcity feeling, we will likely make a suboptimal choice. In the job market, don’t take the offer right away just because you want to escape from the shit hole; In investment, don’t tie money with emotion . Example 2: Job searching again . Now you move to the next stage, pass some interviews, have some opportunities closing to the finishing line, one opportunity is your dream job and you start to dream how great it will be! You start to calculate the expected value and it is an outlier! Great! Awesome! Excited! . My 3rd lesson is: Don’t excite too much about something before it becomes reality. No matter how high your expected value is, it is still the expected value, it doesn’t realize yet. It means the scenario that a low probability event is possible to happen. In the job market, don’t think you made it until you made it; In the lottery, sometimes the expected return of buying a lottery is higher than the cost, it doesn’t mean you should all in . Example 3: H1B visa . In case you don’t know, if international students/workers want to work in the US after OPT (Optional Practicum Training allows STEM graduates to work for 3 years and others 1 year), the main way is to hope to win the H1B lottery. Why is it called a lottery? Because it is, USCIS randomly selected a group of lucky people to submit the applications, and the probability to win H1B is dropping [around 20-30% for people with advanced degree] because of increasing applicants and visa abuse. You can do nothing, literally nothing to influence the final result other than doing a master/PhD and ask your employer to apply it for you. Yet, the result may change your life trajectory completely. . My 4th lesson is: Life is random, maybe a random developer in USCIS inputs a random seed that determines the lives of thousands. This may relieve us a little bit? Outcomes are determined by both human and randomness, we can only choose to do our best and bet another side works out . If we work hard and don’t get what we want, don’t forget randomness, it is just unlucky sometimes, don’t give up If we work hard and get what we want, don’t forget randomness, it is just lucky sometimes, don’t feel smug .",

            "content": "Tech debt . Tech debt is similar to credit cards, if you use it wisely, you can leverage the same resource [fixed engineering resource] to achieve bigger results in the short term. But similar to a credit card, you need to have a strategy to pay that back. . In the workplace, the tech debt is shared by the team . It is your financial issue to pay back your credit cards. Interestingly, in the tech workplace, people who make the debt are usually NOT the people who pay for the debt! It means your tech debt is shared by the team, if the team is great and disciplined [only make the debt when it is necessary], then tech debt is fine as long as you repay that on time. But the most annoying part is when people are not disciplined and keep making the debt, and they also don’t plan to pay that back. Instead, they will just quit and leave the debt to others right before things are out of control. . In the end, someone gets the credits and leaves the whole &amp; future team to pay that back, which I think isn’t ethical. . Solutions . If it is a prototype, dirty &amp; quick is fine, as long as it is just a demo. . If it is for long-term use, involves long-lasting pipelines &amp; complex logic, then design and code review are required to maintain things above a certain standard. . It requires discipline, it requires thinking, and it is not the most comfortable approach. But for the healthy growth of the project/product, it is necessary. . At the very least, given a reasonable timeline and resources, the codebase should be improved with every new PR. . If you don’t have such fortunate, then please, at the very least leave a BIG TODO flag with reasons and explanations. Also, organize the code in a way that you or other people can rewrite easily in the future [functions, no hardcodes, reasonable naming, comments next to non-trivial things, write one or two unit tests for the happy flow]. These things can have 10x+ ROI easily in terms of time. .",

            "title": "The weird part of data science",
            "content": "The weird part of data science . Over the years, I have had different thoughts about the data science industry, just try to write different phases down and organize my thoughts, may not have a very clear message at the end. . At the beginning…… . When I first started to work in the so-called Data Science field, I thought it is cool that I can finally become an ultimate idea man, think about the problem, apply the math/modeling, then success &amp; $ will come. At that time I thought modeling/math is the most important, and I should study even harder. . Then I found that it was not the case, no one at work is interested in reading my math [damn!] or using the complex solution if not needed, actually myself as of now, also hate the “unnecessarily” [&lt;- this is a keyword, don’t overlook] complex solutions, yeah I know they sound cool on the resume. . Business is the most important!? . My mind shifted and thought business is the most important, I tried to involve myself a little bit more in business and tried to control/plan the projects to gain more “influences”. . Turned out I found there are some real insights from business/domain experts, but not many people think about what they are doing, even if you follow the route in that area it will not bring real impacts, but become a better player when climbing the corporate ladder. . Model becomes cool again . Interestingly at that moment, deep learning started to come out and presented very beautiful pictures that seems to have the capabilities to bring the revolution, I was interested in that and tried to think of different possibilities. . Then I joined a startup and found that the embarrassing part of data science is to ask my engineer friends to help, from collecting data, to creating pipelines to do something on top of that, implementation/engineering is the most important! . Engineering is the king . With that in mind, I came to the state to do my master’s in data science, after the previous learnings, I deliberately picked a practicum company that appreciates good engineering practices. That was the good old time, I learned tons within a short amount of time, then I started to work in the US…… . Deliver first . Different companies are different but the very same core is to ask you to deliver first and then be concerned about tech debt. While it may be OK in software engineering, data science works make situations interesting because of their nature and they are the things I keep on thinking . Complexity of DS/ML projects is higher than software of a similar scale . When I think about software, I always think what I am doing is managing the complexity, the demand will change but at a specific time point, it may be fixed for a while, which offers the possibility to introduce more tools and abstractions to manage the complexities. . But data science has two categories of complexities at least, software and data. This becomes very annoying because other than those we experienced in the software, we also need to deal with uncertain data. Whenever I see a 100+ lines query, I already start to feel nervous. Although the query will follow our instructions and do what we asked it to do, when it executes, who knows whether some weird things are happening in the data itself, maybe there are some ingestion problems? . This may not sound a big deal [well we can fix that] but it is illusion because 1. the price to fix them could be really big [maybe you need to redo everything] and 2. when you spot one issue, it usually implies many more. One of my favorite quotes I want to share with more ppl is Amateurs talk about strategy and tactics. Professionals talk about logistics and sustainability in warfare. To apply that to DS/ML projects, amateurs talk about the fancy algorithm, and SOTA, professionals talk about data, business, infrastructure, engineering practice, and sustainability. . So it seems very clear that we should do things right and have the software practices at least similar to software engineering level [good one for sure, eg: well-covered tests, automation tools, organized code; not spaghetti code] . Weird part . But in reality, why do people usually have impressions that DS/ML projects require fewer engineering skills? I have a few hypotheses about this . Job role: people always confuse the job duties of data scientists, it is a mix of engineer, analyst, product manager, and operations. But in reality, the spectrum is very wide, a significant portion of people are working on analytics [things like experimental design, product analytics, etc], instead of developing the algorithms. It doesn’t mean those are less important, as I mentioned above, it is hard to find a good DS in analytics with good business insights and guide the discussions. But they are very different roles and require different skills even though people may have the same title . | People: DS/ML fields are relatively new with fewer hard requirements in the past, it opens up a lot of opportunities for people who are outside of the fields to join. When they climb up in the ecosystem, they start to decide the industry standard, after all, everyone has some path dependencies. . | Project: There are not many high impacted DS/ML projects [I mean those that can become company cashcow], many projects are just good to have, it makes no big difference if you do that at a world-class level or with manual dirty scripts. . | Therefore, it becomes tricky in reality, a field that requires lots of investments and infrastructure support to do well, is using dirty rush methods most of the time. The root issue seemingly is the ROI, if the project doesn’t have a high ROI, why should we invest time and effort to improve that? . The last point brings my mind back to the loop again, business[not office politics] becomes the most important again, how to identify high ROI projects or companies with such potential? That’s one of the reasons I become tired of chasing the SOTA models/reading papers in the recent period. Don’t ask what the DS/ML algorithms can solve, find what problems are worth solving and enough to make my paycheck or fortune, ideally a big one :D .",

            "content": "Start to appreciate ‘boring’ parts of life . For the last two years [since COVID], I have started to appreciate the “boring” parts of life, something I used to think are old school and not cool. . Work . At work, I have started to vote for a simple yet not naive approach, “simple” means easy to deliver solid things and no gotcha; “yet not naive” means there are enough spaces for the extension, just not now. In order to keep lazy, I have started to plan, draw and write down some key things if possible before I get started, I have started to execute slower before the math works out . To the younger me, this would sound impossible, I was very proud of myself with a good memory [even without notes] and the fanciest ways to accomplish something without steps. I remember back to secondary school time, I was quite good at math and always doing all the steps and calculations in my mind, the papers only contained a few unreadable steps and the final answers. If I needed to work with the younger me on some projects now, I would say “F you, don’t skip any steps, I have no interest in reading your mind, I don’t want to guess”! . Daily life . In daily life, I have started to work out regularly, eat breakfast and lately learn something daily. These are quite surprising changes to me, I recall I was one of the weakest [in terms of physical strength] people in secondary school and now I push the barbell and lift the dumbbell a few times per week in my room. I make my [the very same] breakfast after I wake up whereas I only had breakfast during the weekend because I need to have breakfast with my family [HK Dimsum!]. I now open the site to learn something after dinner, whereas I found some mobile games to spend my nights. . Social life . In social life, I kept on thinking about the cool events to go to with my friends, but now I really enjoy less-is-more ._. Just coming out, having a coffee/dinner, and chatting is enough to make me happy. . . Not sure whether it means I am “older” now or COVID transforms me into this way, but I quite enjoy the current simple style if I could meet my friends even easier.

            "title": "How to choose jobs in the DS world",
            "content": "How to choose jobs in the DS world? . This is what I have struggled with in my mind over the years, what is a good DS job……. To solve this problem, I have created the checklist/questions which I hope the previous me could read before making the career decision. I won’t talk about compensation/tech details/interviews, that’s another story You are not always in the position to choose (such as finding jobs during COVID-19) but you should seriously evaluate your options if you can . Job nature . There are thousands of jobs sharing the same title, eg: data scientist, data engineer, ml engineer. But they could be totally different from company to company, be aware! The first thing I will look into is the skill requirements to identify the job nature If it is analytics, expect tons of SQL, dashboards, presentations, product analytics, and experimental designs. You probably need to enjoy talking to people, finding insights, and guiding the business, which means you need to be a domain expert in that business. In short, I think it is more like a business/PM/consultant type of role, but from a data perspective If it is engineering, be alert if the job responsibilities are vague, and don’t make assumptions, let me repeat: don’t make assumptions! For example, the people who share the data engineer title may do completely different things. Some are developing ETL pipelines; some are working on instrumentation; some are building the new data / ML infrastructure. You should think clearly about whether that fits your career plan! Also, another common “trap” is internal transfer, you want to get into the company first and switch to the roles you want, while I don’t deny the possibility, don’t be over-optimistic in your calculation, hope is not a strategy . If it is modeling, I will consider two things, one is the value of the models, and another is the team maturity. For example, developing a model for Dogecoin price prediction sounds great but the outcome is probably not promising. Team maturity is another consideration, be aware of the team is too green or even worse, you are the first member. They will sell as every startup does: you will have enough space to innovate. There are success stories but think about survival bias. If you are super capable/team lead level, it may be worth trying; if not, then……… . Business/product model . Personally, I think this is the fundamental factor to determine your scope and potential achievements in the organization, and financial uplift, I will ask myself the following questions: . How do you justify your (or your team’s) paycheck in that business/product? How large is the potential uplift? This question requires you to think about how the company makes for living, and what area you can contribute. For example, in traditional industries such as merchandising, they probably don’t need advanced ML yet but they need to digitalize their business first. So even if you are a genius in ML, there are no such demands, and your deliverables will likely be ppt or fitting some models on some data in a Jupyter notebook. You will likely try to establish some KPIs or standardize the business workflow and get rejections from business experts. The trap here is these companies usually say they are willing to change/digitalize themselves, but that usually won’t happen because that doesn’t fit their previous success path, your role is in fact threatening the interests of the original core team if you can’t show values quickly. Don’t recommend it unless you are confident that you can be an asset rather than a liability. | What is the “resource complexity” to scale? O(1)? O(n)? O(n**k)? The software industry is different from others because it is much easier to scale, or in economic terms, the marginal cost of software approaches zero. But not every software has such a property, especially B2B solutions. In recent years, there are tons of “AI companies” developing their solutions in different verticals and planning to sell them. The happy flow is they will develop one algorithm/system and run it in different customer systems, since the companies in the vertical are mostly giant companies [eg: banking, telecom, retailers, airlines], they can afford a big bill if the solution is nice! But the unideal parts are: selling solutions to business usually require custom integration, which hurts the scalability and increases the marginal cost, A LOT, especially if you are using AI [those deep learning things]. Deep learning models are still a black box, there are too many edge cases if the business requires more than the simple &amp; straightforward use cases. These companies can definitely make money if the margin is big but nature will become more like a service or integration company, aka human-intensive. So from an employee perspective, it implies you will need to do one project after another, hence operational tasks/projects may take up significant amounts of your time and you have less time for R&amp;D / innovative things if those are what you want. To compare the difference, imagine SaaS companies like Confluence [The company that makes Jira], the marginal cost to serve one more user is close to zero and even if they don’t develop any feature for a whole quarter, it won’t affect their growth in the short run. These companies hence usually have more time &amp; resources to experiment the new things because the business outputs could be detached from employee’s work hours and client’s business logic | business/product model also affects the operations, A LOT! We are doing DS so where is the data? SaaS / B2C products don’t feel such pains because users will likely use their developed applications, and engineers can implement tracking or log the events in servers to collect the data [there are also some headaches but everything is under your control, at least before Apple’s App Tracking Transparency]. But imagine if your clients are government, banks, airlines, and retailers, and you have an ML solution for parts of their processes. Then you need to ask them for the data, you need to understand their schema &amp; business logic, handle the dirty data, and come up with tons of workarounds to run your models. That isn’t fun because your time is tied to the outcomes &amp; your work is constrained by others. Never imagine those companies will change their process because of your product, never assume their digitalization level will boost suddenly to meet modern software requirements. You will probably be woken by PagerDuty and live with tech debts until the end of your tenure there instead Nice article from a16z to discuss AI companies | Team . Your supervisor and team contribute a huge chunk to your job satisfaction, they can determine whether it is an amazing or nightmare experience. But this part is quite general for every job, some key signals I recommend you to look for are: . Growth mindset: Do they adapt to a growth mindset? Do they encourage people to grow but not box them like a robot? Do they micromanage? How do they make the decisions? Are they humble? Get this information during interviews | Atmosphere: Are they a happy team? Are they humor？Are they willing to share their insights and knowledge? This will signal whether people are psychologically safe, if the answer is no, you better understand why and whether you can accept that. Mental health and growth are even more important than your compensation after a certain threshold. A mismatched atmosphere will make you become a philosopher, stay away from the toxic culture, it makes you negative, short-term focused, and anxious! | Experience: Is the team experienced? If not, you may have a hard time getting up to speed. BTW, companies usually frame this shortcoming as challenge/opportunity, calculate the odds yourself | Company . Do due diligence carefully Go to Glassdoor/Blind, and check the negative reviews because they are mostly true. My theory is that 5-star reviews could be neglected because they fits the company’s interest but you should read and evaluate every word in 1-star reviews | Check the background of the management Are they experienced? Do they know what they are doing? Do you have networks that work with/for them? Give them a call! These are important because inevitably there are up and down in business, and these factors will take effect at that critical moment | Check company retention Are there many people leaving recently? That may be a signal | Check funding status if you are applying for a startup | Trust your guts idk, but whenever I feel something weird / doesn’t make sense, they are usually true, unfortunately. Be rational, don’t be over-optimistic. Remember they are trying to sell you the company, which means they are like a sales team and show only beautiful pictures in your mind. Be rational! | Conclusions . Unless you are super lucky and get your dream job, your decision should be tradeoff b/w various factors we discussed above . Some people enjoy coding while some people enjoy talking to people | Some people enjoy quiet culture while some people enjoy a happy &amp; open culture | Some people prefer stability while some people prefer growth (risk) | Some people prefer B2B because of easier monetization while some people prefer B2C because of the possibility of rapid scaling As long as you have evaluated the options carefully and understood the potential good and bad, the rest is your choice! | .

            "content": "For a long time, I confused their relationship . When I had my statistics class, I always confused these three in my mind: . Chebyshev’s inequality [I don’t know how to pronounce :- , usually just call it CS inequality]: met it a few times in my life but didn’t leave me a big impression. . Law of large number &amp; Central Limit Theorem: always use them interchangeably, but deep in my heart I remember they are different . Recently in a conversation with my friend, we talked about some hypothesis testing things [t-test], we discussed the assumptions of t-test like this: . A: Yeah, you see, even the distribution shapes of these two populations are different By the central limit theorem, the means will follow normal distribution regardless of the shape We can still use it even if the distributions are not normal B: Sure, the law of large numbers right? As we have more samples they will coverage and hence t-test is valid even if the distributions are not normal A: oooo seemingly right..... . Obviously, I am A, but I was hesitant for a few seconds because I forgot what is the law of large numbers and how is it related to CLT! I remember they have some subtle differences. Therefore, I revisit the materials in the probability course recently to answer the difference myself, and what the hell is Chebyshev’s inequality . Chebyshev’s inequality . Recall the basic numbers for distribution, expected value, and variance, one describes the central tendency, another describes the spreads of the distribution . If the variance is small, the distribution is not that widely spread, it is less likely to get the outcome far away from the mean . In mathematical terms, it is less likely to see abs(X - u) &gt;= certain number, hence Pr[ abs(X - u) &gt;= certain number ] should be small. . When that certain number becomes even bigger, that probability should become even smaller [less likely]. . Chebyshev’s inequality basically states this relationship using expected value and variance: . Pr[ abs(X - E(X)) &gt;= a ] &lt;= Var(X) / a^2 for a &gt; 0 | . The importance of this equation is that we can calculate the sample size after we specify what level of confidence and bound we want . It is also beautiful! Link expected value and variance together in one inequality regardless of distributions . Law of large number . Recall the fact that variance will decrease when n increases and take a look at Chebyshev’s inequality again! . Pr( abs(X - u) &gt;= a) &lt;= Var(X) / a^2 for a &gt; 0 | Var(X) -&gt; 0 as n increases | . Therefore, Pr[ abs(X - E(X)) &gt;= a ] -&gt; 0 for a &gt; 0 Therefore, Pr[ abs(mean(X) - E(X) &gt;= a ] -&gt; 0 . The Law of large number basically tells us the sample average will converge to the expected value when n increases, the basis of statistics and simulation . Central Limit Theorem . CLT tells us the average of n observations of ANY r.v will follow normal, ALL distributions, no matter how complex it is as long as mean and variance are finite . Conclusion . Now rethink what each of them is doing . CS inequality tells us that the difference b/w sample and expected value is bounded . LLN tells us the difference b/w sample mean and expected value is not only bounded but coverages to zero when n increases . CLT tells us the sample mean not only coverages, but the distribution of the sample mean converges to the normal distribution when n increases regardless of underlying distributions . CLT makes the biggest claim and hence is also the most famous, valuable, and the backbone of statistics . Recall the t-test conversation . A: Yeah, you see, even the distribution shapes of these two populations are different By the central limit theorem, the means will follow normal distribution regardless of the shape We can still use it even if the distributions are not normal B: Sure, the law of large number right? As we have more samples they will coverage and hence t-test is valid even if the distributions are not normal ^^^This statement is not correct^^^ # sample mean does converge to the expected value # but nothing to do with converging to a normal distribution, that&#39;s the magic of CLT A: oooo seemingly right..... . Disclaimer . Some of them are not precise &amp; complete descriptions, eg you may rmb weak/strong law of large number, reading a mathematical statistics book may be more useful. .",

This article records part of my learnings from my practicum at Manifold AI! I remember I was a big fan of Jupyter Notebook and wanted to use it for everything! . My first time to use Jupyter Notebook in work [not exploration / homework] was to try Databricks to handle some data processing works. I was amazed by the notebook style because I am not from CS background and I would love to see what is happening in every step! . But I found that those colleagues with CS background don’t prefer this way, I had no clues why. Slowly, I started to feel inconvenient too when the processing logics are more and more complex…….Well, things are still working……. . Until I worked in Manifold AI and needed to write the whole workflow, I finally found that it is much much easier &amp; more flexible to run the code by a list of commands instead of a long Notebook…… . Plus, I have the habit to write unit tests whenever possible after I experienced how painful it is when you try to refactor any non-trival codebase. . During the painful job searching period in 2020 [wtf graduated during COVID-19], I didn’t have many things to do so I summarized and wrote this up. .",

I graduated with my BSc in Statistics from CUHK, the place that I am proud of &lt;3. . I worked in various companies in Hong Kong! I am glad to meet a lot of great leaders &amp; colleagues and learn from them. . . Move to SF Bay Area: 2019 - Now . In 2019, I moved to the Bay Area to attend the University of San Francisco’s MSDS. I enjoy the environment [maybe not the downtown :( ] and all the great people I have met in the Bay Area! Sadly, I cannot experience the “normal” social life because of COVID :( . from time to time, I have some random walks around the Bay side, walk, sit and think . MSDS and Manifold: 2019 - 2020 . I am fortunate enough to do my practium at Manifold AI and work on some open-ended research using deep learning with world class tech-leaders and hardcore engineers. This experience also changes my understandings in ML/DS and engineering in general! . . Interests . My interests are DS and engineering in general, I am particularly interested in ML/DS workflow. I honor the Three Virtues of a programmer and love to bring those virtues to ML/DS world! . Outside work and study, I have started to pick up cooking skills since 2020 [because of COVID]. I have also spent some times on Brawl Stars [hit me by #C2QRU8QQ]. Reading is also a big component of my life, I enjoy history and psychology most! I will probably include some books that impact me the most in a section of this site . For this site . I don’t think I will take aggressive approach [aka job searching] for this blog. Afterall I see there are so many blogs without updates for years after the authors found the job LOL I don’t want to be one of them and hope to sustain this blog longer. I will probably treat this as my private space and library to keep track of my thoughts and learnings. . Depending on materials, maybe I will use Chinese 中文 some times .",

          "content": "Salary negotiation . A good overview of salary negotiation, not necessary for salary only, but for other parts of life as well . Write good code? or write poor code with endless fix? . This is a good question, for me, I try to prefer the first option if possible, but my final answer is it depends . The story in the link is a conversation in an ancient Chinese story [魏文侯问扁鹊] b/w a king and the best doctor at that time. One day, the king asked the doctor: among your brothers, who is the best doctor? The doctor replied: My oldest brother is the best, followed by the second oldest, and I am the worst. . The king was confused, isn’t you the best one? . The doctor said: My oldest brother can notice &amp; fix the problems perfectly BEFORE it becomes a problem, the patients think he does nothing and only our family know he is the best. . My second oldest brother can notice &amp; fix the problems WHEN it first appears, the patients think he can only fix the small cases. . I can only notice the problems AFTER they become serious, the patients are impressed by my fancy treatments and risky operations, therefore, everyone knows me . Which one do you prefer :-)? . . Resources: Made with ML . This material is super awesome! Contains all the things I wish to learn connecting ML and engineering! Other than concepts, the example codes are great, no BS, I can just reference, copy, use them right away and it WORKS! . . 机器学习：软件工程方法与实现 . The direct translation is “Machine Learning: software engineering and implementation”. Surprisingly good and practical book that introduces the ML work in reality [including the software engineering side with main focus on non-deep learning areas] and offers the high level picture of different aspects in reality, strongly recommend if you can read Chinese . . Designing Data-Intensive Applications . Maybe one of the best tech books in recent years, must read for serious players in data science / ML engineering, period . . Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind . I have met many people said they have read this, maybe it is too famous lol I have read it and finished the Coursera course from the same author. . The single view that impacts me most is: humans are living in both subjective and objective world. In fact, money, nation, values etc are all constructed by our minds. They are meaningless if no one believe that . . Resources: Sebastian Raschka . In short, this is the first place I will go if I need to review the topics about ML/DL. I particularly enjoy the clear &amp; easy-to-follow logic. Plus, there are many code examples! . . Resources: Full Stack Deep Learning . Cover almost everything I want to learn about ML workflow, strongly recommend if you need to worry engineering part of the ML as well . . Coursera: 史記 . 「從歷史來看，決定人生成敗的不過就是兩樣東西，第一是運氣，第二是自我要求。什麼是運氣？往大的方面來說，生在什麼時代是運氣，生在什麼國家是運氣，生在什麼家庭也是運氣。往小的說，出門左轉或右轉，接不接一個電話人生可能就不一樣，運氣對每個人就是這麼重要。但是運氣不可測也不能控制，我們所能控制的只有自我要求，如果我們真心想成為什麼樣的人，是真心不是發夢想想，就必須不斷奮鬥努力讓自己具有足夠條件，等待偶然的機會」 . 這段課文感受良多，沒有人會希望運氣不好，人品好做好準備也是會有倒楣的時候，但個人只能控制自我要求，想成為什麼境界的人就做什麼事 . . How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big . I knew Scott Adams because of his cartoons. This book shares many practical “principles” that impact me a lot, eg: . Goals are for losers; systems are for winners [the world is so random, it is hard to set the goal to become millionaire next year but we can do what millionaire will do] | Passion is useless [sad but true, no one is interested in how passionate Steve Jobs is before his success] | A combination of mediocre skills can make you surprisingly valuable [few top 10% skills maybe better than a single top 1%] | . . Atomic Habits . I found this after I read “systems are for winners” from Scott Adams’s book. If I need to summarize the whole book, below are my takes: . Find the habits you want to build and decompose until it is almost impossible to fail eg: fitness: instead of going to Gym room 4 times a week, just do at least 3 push up per day | eg: reading: instead of reading certain pages, just read at least one paragraph per day | eg: programming: instead of doing 10 Leetcode during weekend, just do the daily challenge | . | After you identify the habits, do them for 21+ days . | Don’t cultivate too many at a time | . Video: DO NOT SPLIT 不割席 . As Hong Konger, it doesn’t make sense if I tell you I have no views on what happened over the last few years :( It is sad that the conflicts will probably last for decades b/w the people and you can do nth about that. . Over these 2 years, I always have these questions in my mind: . The conflict could be resolved easily from the beginning, how is it possible that the government picked the worst possible options and escalated the situation to irreversible? . | At what cost people are willing to pay for what they disagree on? It is naive to deny/justify the violence that happened. The issue is after you have tried all the possible peaceful means and got no response, it is encouraging people to go to extremes, especially if they are not the minority. People always talk about the events since 2019 July but they don’t discuss why the government gave no response after a peaceful protest with 2 millions+ [aka around 1/3 of the city population]. . | In my view, this is removing the brake from the movement because the peaceful supporters cannot propose another way but sit back. When did the stupid government ask why do you not condemn the violence? The answer is simple: it was you who told us peaceful marches did not work, it was you who removed the brake when we asked you not to. . | Who should be responsible? Well……it is like……someone turns on the lighter and burns the house, will you blame why the house is flammable when everyone asks you not to? It is sad that hundreds if not thousands of protestors may be in jail at last for the disaster that could be avoided from the beginning. . | I don’t hold any particular “political beliefs”, I don’t like the bundle package because the narrative makes us give up our rational thinking. As long as we are solving the problems but not solving the people who raise the problems, any idea should be evaluated to considered and evaluated. . | .",
