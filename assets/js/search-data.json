I worked in various companies in Hong Kong! I am glad to learn and meet a lot of great leaders and colleagues. . Move to SF Bay Area . In 2019, I moved to the Bay Area to attend the University of San Francisco’s MSDS. I love the environment [maybe not the downtown :( ] and all the great people I have met in the Bay Area! . MSDS and Manifold . I am fortunate enough to do my practium at Manifold AI and work on some open-ended research problem - System Identification with world class tech-leaders and hardcode engineers. I have learned a lot from this experience and it also changes my understandings in ML/DS and engineering in general! . Interests . My interests are DS and engineering in general, I am particularly interested in ML/DS workflow. I honor the Three Virtues of a programmer and love to bring those virtues to ML/DS world! . Outside work and study, I have started to pick up cooking skills since 2020 [because of COVID for sure]. I have also spent some times on Brawl Stars. Reading is also a big component of my life, I enjoy history and psychology most! .",

I have met many people said they have read this, maybe it is too famous lol I have read it and finished the Coursera course from the same author. . The single view that impacts me most is: humans are living in both subjective and objective world. In fact, money, nation, values etc are all constructed by our minds. They are meaningless if no one believe that . .",
