            "content": "Medium link . This is an old article I posted in Medium, I may just provide the link without reproducing it here! . This article records part of my learnings from my practicum at Manifold AI! I remember I was a big fan of Jupyter Notebook and wanted to use it for everything! . My first time to use Jupyter Notebook in work [not exploration / homework] was to try Databricks to handle some data processing works. I was amazed by the notebook style because I am not from CS background and I would love to see what is happening in every step! . But I found that those colleagues with CS background don’t prefer this way, I had no clues why. Slowly, I started to feel inconvenient too when the processing logics are more and more complex…….Well, things are still working……. . Until I worked in Manifold AI and needed to write the whole workflow, I finally found that it is much much easier &amp; more flexible to run the code by a list of commands instead of a long Notebook…… . Plus, I have the habit to write unit tests whenever possible after I experienced how painful it is when you try to refactor any non-trival codebase. . During the painful job searching period in 2020 [wtf graduated during COVID-19], I didn’t have many things to do so I summarized and wrote this up. .",

          "content": "Start from Hong Kong: 199X - 2019 . Yoooo! I am Geoffrey from Hong Kong, currently in California! I graduated with my BSc in Statistics from CUHK, the place that I am proud of &lt;3. . I worked in various companies in Hong Kong! I am glad to meet a lot of great leaders &amp; colleagues and learn from them. . . Move to SF Bay Area: 2019 - Now . In 2019, I moved to the Bay Area to attend the University of San Francisco’s MSDS. I enjoy the environment [maybe not the downtown :( ] and all the great people I have met in the Bay Area! Sadly, I cannot experience the “normal” social life because of COVID :( . from time to time, I have some random walks around the Bay side, walk, sit and think . MSDS and Manifold: 2019 - 2020 . I am fortunate enough to do my practium at Manifold AI and work on some open-ended research using deep learning with world class tech-leaders and hardcore engineers. This experience also changes my understandings in ML/DS and engineering in general! . . Interests . My interests are DS and engineering in general, I am particularly interested in ML/DS workflow. I honor the Three Virtues of a programmer and love to bring those virtues to ML/DS world! . Outside work and study, I have started to pick up cooking skills since 2020 [because of COVID]. I have also spent some times on Brawl Stars [hit me by #C2QRU8QQ]. Reading is also a big component of my life, I enjoy history and psychology most! I will probably include some books that impact me the most in a section of this site . For this site . I don’t think I will take aggressive approach [aka job searching] for this blog. Afterall I see there are so many blogs without updates for years after the authors found the job LOL I don’t want to be one of them and hope to sustain this blog longer. I will probably treat this as my private space and library to keep track of my thoughts and learnings. . Depending on materials, maybe I will use Chinese 中文 some times .",

          "content": "Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind . I have met many people said they have read this, maybe it is too famous lol I have read it and finished the Coursera course from the same author. . The single view that impacts me most is: humans are living in both subjective and objective world. In fact, money, nation, values etc are all constructed by our minds. They are meaningless if no one believe that . . Resources: Sebastian Raschka . In short, this is the first place I will go if I need to review the topics about ML/DL. I particularly enjoy the clear &amp; easy-to-follow logic. Plus, there are many code examples! . . Coursera: 史記 . 「從歷史來看，決定人生成敗的不過就是兩樣東西，第一是運氣，第二是自我要求。什麼是運氣？往大的方面來說，生在什麼時代是運氣，生在什麼國家是運氣，生在什麼家庭也是運氣。往小的說，出門左轉或右轉，接不接一個電話人生可能就不一樣，運氣對每個人就是這麼重要。但是運氣不可測也不能控制，我們所能控制的只有自我要求，如果我們真心想成為什麼樣的人，是真心不是發夢想想，就必須不斷奮鬥努力讓自己具有足夠條件，等待偶然的機會」 . 這段課文感受良多，沒有人會希望運氣不好，人品好做好準備也是會有倒楣的時候，但個人只能控制自我要求，想成為什麼境界的人就做什麼事 . . How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big . I knew Scott Adams because of his cartoons. This book shares many practical “principles” that impact me a lot, eg: . Goals are for losers; systems are for winners [the world is so random, it is hard to set the goal to become millionaire next year but we can do what millionaire will do] | Passion is useless [sad but true, no one is interested in how passionate Steve Jobs is before his success] | A combination of mediocre skills can make you surprisingly valuable [few top 10% skills maybe better than a single top 1%] | . . Atomic Habits . I read this after I read “systems are for winners” from Scott Adams’s book. If I need to summarize the whole book, below are my takes: . find the habits you want to build and decompose it until it is almost impossible to fail eg: fitness: instead of going to Gym room 4 times a week, just do at least 3 push up per day eg: reading: instead of reading certain pages, just read at least one paragraph per day eg: programming: instead of doing 10 Leetcode per day, just do the daily question . | after you identify the habits, do them for 21+ days . | don’t cultivate too many at a time . | .",
