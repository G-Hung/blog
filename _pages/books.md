# [Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind](https://www.amazon.com/Sapiens-Humankind-Yuval-Noah-Harari-ebook/dp/B00ICN066A)

I have met many people said they have read this, maybe it is too famous lol I have read it and finished the Coursera course from the same author.

The single view that impacts me most is: humans are living in both subjective and objective world. In fact, money, nation, values etc are all constructed by our minds. They are meaningless if no one believe that

# [Resources: Sebastian Raschka](https://sebastianraschka.com/resources.html)

In short, this is the first place I will go if I need to review the topics about ML/DL. I particularly enjoy the clear & easy-to-follow logic. Plus, there are many code examples!

# [Coursera: 史記](https://www.coursera.org/learn/shiji)

「從歷史來看，決定人生成敗的不過就是兩樣東西，第一是運氣，第二是自我要求。什麼是運氣？往大的方面來說，生在什麼時代是運氣，生在什麼國家是運氣，生在什麼家庭也是運氣。往小的說，出門左轉或右轉，接不接一個電話人生可能就不一樣，運氣對每個人就是這麼重要。但是運氣不可測也不能控制，我們所能控制的只有自我要求，如果我們真心想成為什麼樣的人，是真心不是發夢想想，就必須不斷奮鬥努力讓自己具有足夠條件，等待偶然的機會」

這段課文感受良多，沒有人會希望運氣不好，人品好做好準備也是會有倒楣的時候，但個人只能控制自我要求，想成為什麼境界的人就做什麼事

# [How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big](https://www.amazon.com/How-Fail-Almost-Everything-Still-ebook/dp/B00COOFBA4)

I knew Scott Adams because of his cartoons. This book shares many practical "principles" that impact me a lot, eg:
- Goals are for losers; systems are for winners [the world is so random, it is hard to set the goal to become millionaire next year but we can do what millionaire will do]
- Passion is useless [sad but true, no one is interested in how passionate Steve Jobs is before his success]
- A combination of mediocre skills can make you surprisingly valuable [few top 10% skills maybe better than a single top 1%]

# [Atomic Habits](https://www.amazon.com/Atomic-Habits-Proven-Build-Break/dp/0735211299)

I found this after I read "systems are for winners" from Scott Adams's book. If I need to summarize the whole book, below are my takes:

1. Find the habits you want to build and decompose until it is almost impossible to fail
- eg: fitness: instead of going to Gym room 4 times a week, just do at least 3 push up per day
- eg: reading: instead of reading certain pages, just read at least one paragraph per day
- eg: programming: instead of doing 10 Leetcode during weekend, just do the daily challenge

2. After you identify the habits, do them for 21+ days

3. Don't cultivate too many at a time
