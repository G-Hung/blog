# [Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind](https://www.amazon.com/Sapiens-Humankind-Yuval-Noah-Harari-ebook/dp/B00ICN066A)

I have met many people said they have read this, maybe it is too famous lol I have read it and finished the Coursera course from the same author.

The single view that impacts me most is: humans are living in both subjective and objective world. In fact, money, nation, values etc are all constructed by our minds. They are meaningless if no one believe that
