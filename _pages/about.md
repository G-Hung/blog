## Start from Hong Kong
Yoooo! I am Geoffrey from Hong Kong, currently in California! After graduating with my BSc in Statistics from [CUHK](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/), the place that I am proud of <3. I worked in various companies in Hong Kong! I am glad to learn and meet a lot of great leaders and colleagues. 

## Move to SF Bay Area
In 2019, I moved to the Bay Area to attend the University of San Francisco's [MSDS](https://www.usfca.edu/arts-sciences/graduate-programs/data-science). I love the environment [maybe not the downtown :( ] and all the great people I have met in the Bay Area! 

## MSDS and Manifold
I am fortunate enough to do my practium at [Manifold AI](https://manifold.ai/) and work on some open-ended research problem - [System Identification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_identification) with world class tech-leaders and hardcode engineers. I have learned a lot from this experience and it also changes my understandings in ML/DS and engineering in general!

## Interests
My interests are DS and engineering in general, I am particularly interested in ML/DS workflow. I honor the [Three Virtues](http://threevirtues.com/) of a programmer and love to bring those virtues to ML/DS world!

Outside work and study, I have started to pick up cooking skills since 2020 [because of COVID for sure]. I have also spent some times on Brawl Stars. Reading is also a big component of my life, I enjoy history and psychology most!
